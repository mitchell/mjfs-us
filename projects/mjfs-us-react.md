# mjfs.us (React.js version)

The previous version of this site. I've built and rebuilt my personal website in many technologies,
but this is just a simple TypeScript React SPA. Before using TS, I put Flow up to the same task and
was pleasantly surprised, but ultimately won over in other projects by TS.

This site was hosted on S3 and cached/distributed around the US by Cloudfront, much like the new
site. It was also continuously deployed using TravisCI.
