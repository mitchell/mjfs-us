# Mystro

## Lead Developer

#### July 2022 - Present

Fully develop and deploy user-ready port of original Mystro iOS and Android native apps into a
single React-Native codebase. Support the application while implementing advanced features, like
real-time filtering and native modules for automation and networking features. Develop supporting
web services for things like tracking user rewards and data ingestion for analytics.

Additionally, I help to onboard/mentor new engineers to the team and plan development. As well as,
spending time improving the ease of development by configuring and maintaining developer tooling and
semi-automated deployment via OTA updates.
